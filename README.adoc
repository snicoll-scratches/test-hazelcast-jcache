# Hazelcast with JCache annotations

This sample demonstrates how you can use `Hazelcast` with the `javax.cache` annotations
and yet keep access to the `Hazelcast` specific API.

## The problem

If you add `javax.cache:cache-api`, `spring-boot-starter-cache` and `hazeclast-spring` you
have all the necessary dependencies to use `Hazelcast` as a cache store but both the
`JCache` and the "`Spring`" implementations are available.

Spring Boot promotes the use of `JCache` so if that's available we use that by default.

Since `Hazelcast` has many other features that just caching, `Hazelcast` is generally
supported (outside caching that is). A default setup with such classpath will lead to the
following:

1. `HazelcastAutoConfiguration` kicks-in and auto-configure a `HazelcastInstance` based on
the configuration in `src/main/resources/hazelcast.xml`
2. `CacheAutoConfiguration` kicks-in and chose the `JCache` flavour, this bootstraps a new
`javax.cache.CacheManager` using the regular
`Caching.getCachingProvider().getCacheManager()`
3. For reasons yet to be determined, `Hazelcast` starts a second time rather than
realising an `HazelcastInstance` for that configuration file exists

## The solution

There is no reason to go `JCache` if you don't want to use the API to configure your cache
infrastructure. Spring Boot allows you to use the `javax.cache` annotations with any
cache provider (as demonstrated in this sample).

So the only thing you should do really is to force the use of `hazelcast` rather than
`jcache` by adding the following to your configuration

```
spring.cache.type=hazelcast
```
